#### Safeguard Text : )
*The website neither hosts data being displayed nor stores somewhere else.
Values are directly replicated/scraped from [MyGov](https://mygov.in/covid-19) which is an authentic source of public information in India.
I would like to mention these 4 types of patients details is the only 
data that it collects which comes under public information.
The project was only made for educational purpose I do not support web scraping of private data.*
